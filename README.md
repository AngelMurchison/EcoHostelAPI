# EcoHostelAPI
An API I'm writing for an eco-hostel to use as their reservation service. 

It is a work in progress and I'm working with Sara Toftegaard (https://github.com/satoftegaard) who is designing and building the frontend. You can find the front-end hosted at http://eco-hostel.satoftegaard.surge.sh/ but it isn't necessarily up-to-date with the features represented in this repository.
